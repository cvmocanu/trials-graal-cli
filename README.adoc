== Intro

This repository shows how to build a native binary command line application from Kotlin sources, using GraalVM native-image.

The native binary is statically linked (no dynamic dependencies needed).

== Build

1. Make sure you have OpenJDK 11 in the PATH (for Gradle to use).
2. Make sure you have the native build tools installed (more information on the link:https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[Native Image] page, the "Prerequisite" section:
* for Linux and Mac, `glibc-devel`, `zlib-devel`, and `gcc` are required. In addition, for Linux, `libstdc++` is also required.
** on Ubuntu, `sudo apt install -y build-essential` should be enough (not tested)
** on Mac, `xcode-select --install` should be enough
* for Windows, you need the link:https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vs_buildtools.exe[Visual Studio 2017 Visual C++ Build Tools]

3. open a terminal and run:

[source, shell script]
----
./gradlew nativeImage
----

== Test the binary

You can find the result at `./build/graal/trials-graal-cli`.

[source, shell script]
----
$ time ./build/graal/trials-graal-cli --help
Usage: mycli [-hV]
Says hello
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
./build/graal/trials-graal-cli --help  0,00s user 0,01s system 94% cpu 0,006 total
----

Note that the binary took a total of 6 milliseconds to execute. No more waiting for the JVM to startup! üëç
